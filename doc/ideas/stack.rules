A stack is a hierarchical list of things. You put a vaguely defined
really big thing at the bottom, and break it down into a handful (5 to 7
at most) smaller things, then choose one of those and break it down,
creating a stack with smaller things above bigger things. The rules
of the game are:

1) you don't subdivide more than a single thing at each level. For
   example, if you've got 5 level 2 things, you pick only one of those
   and divide it into level 3 things.

2) the goal is to divide things into smaller and smaller pieces until
   you can actually just do the pieces. I try to get them into pieces
   small enough for Flashtasks, which are things that you can do in 
   (hopefully) 7 minutes or less. You set a timer and work on it like
   crazy for that time. If you don't finish, you have a few options --
   see the Flashtasks writeup for details.

3) If you can't finish a thing until you do something else, and the
   something else is at a lower level (or part of a lower level), you
   move the thing into a separate location (backlog/notes).

4) Keep status/notes of everything in a separate file/location, so that
   the top of the stack is just the next thing to do.

5) It's OK to re-order the top items of the same depth, but not anything
   else. The order of the lower levels isn't really important -- that is,
   if you're working on level 5 stuff, when you finish it all, you can
   choose whatever level 4 item you want to split up for the next batch
   of level 5 items.

6) The objective is simple: don't think more about things than you have
   to, and don't worry about anything except the top of the stack.

7) You can edit / revise / delete the top level of the stack whenever you
   want. If you want to change something lower down, just add some notes
   to your notes file. Try to keep your "active" notes separate from your
   log notes.
