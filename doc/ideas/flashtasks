I had an idea a few weeks ago that seemed worth trying out,
and have been experimenting with it.

Just like "Flashcards" are meant to help you learn something
in tiny increments, I think "Flashtasks" can be used to
do something large by breaking it down into tiny pieces.

I have a timer that I set (typically) for 7 minutes, for each
Flashtask. That's a small enough amount of time that I can
usually do it, even if I don't actually finish what I wanted
to do.

Strategy:

1) break a larger task -- e.g. the top item on a "stack" (see
   notes) into things that might take as little as 7 minutes
2) set a timer, and start the top one
   a) if you get done before the timer, stop it and move on
   b) if you don't finish, add a new flashtask -- either next
      on the list, or sometime later.
3) this is kind of like a calendar item more than a todo item,
   since it's a list that you do in order, and its time based
4) the objective is to keep track of how many flashtasks you
   do per day, and try to increase the number over time. 
5) every time you complete one, don't just count it, but also
   raise your arms in the air and say "yes!" or do something
   else physical (dance!) to show your subconscious that it's
   a great thing
