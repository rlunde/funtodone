I thought I'd start by trying to fix some eslint warnings
tonight, and realized that I didn't have any test runner
installed yet. Since I'm trying mocha with another project,
I thought I'd try out jest for this one (especially since
jest fits better with react).

I also found that right clicking in vscode and selecting
command palette gives me the option to auto-fix eslint errors,
which saves a lot of time. (I had to do it twice in some
cases.)
