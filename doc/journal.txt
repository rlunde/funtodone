I thought I'd start by trying to fix some eslint warnings
tonight, and realized that I didn't have any test runner
installed yet. Since I'm trying mocha with another project,
I thought I'd try out jest for this one (especially since
jest fits better with react).

I also found that right clicking in vscode and selecting
command palette gives me the option to auto-fix eslint errors,
which saves a lot of time. (I had to do it twice in some
cases.)

I'm choosing which project to work on each evening by
picking one randomly, along with a kind of activity (e.g. code,
simplify, document, test). I weighted it heavily towards
goodwin or sideauth for now, but funtodone, thing-a-day, and
writertoys are still in the mix (I don't want to forget
everything about them before they become top priority, but
I also don't want to try to do too many things at once.)

Tonight's task is: code/funtodone

Note that there are two different journal.txt files here:
1) this one under funtodone/doc which is about overall project stuff
2) the one under src/client, which is just about the client side

I'm working on client stuff tonight, so that's where the rest of 
my journal will go tonight.

Today's random project: design/funtodone

See the journal.txt under client/ for what I did tonight.
I really should only have one of these.
