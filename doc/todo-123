a) work on logging in (client page, server code)
   1) update the page structure to use states in react as in states.txt
      see: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/conditional-rendering.html
   2) work on creating a login
      a) try to make a user in mongodb
        i) handle the form to create a new user
        ii) create the new user in the database
        iii) send email to confirm the new account
        iv) handle the click on the email confirmation
        v) record that the email is verified and account is gosessionid
      b) do a normal login

b) think about starting a new structure based on Stephen Grider's
   https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter
   see client2 -- need to do that if I'm going to use ES6 modules
   rather than CommonJS, I think?
