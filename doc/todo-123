a)[x] I'm trying to start with the official create-react-app from Facebook:
   https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html

b)[x] after that, I'm modifying it based on Stephen Grider's Udemy course, that starts with:
   https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter

c) I found an interesting article on adding redux to create-react-app without
   using eject: https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f
   
d) next steps
   1) get a basic app layout in place
   2) add a login/signup form
   3) integrate with sideauth
