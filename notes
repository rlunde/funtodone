The node_modules under client originally came along with the sample I installed from todomvc,
but others (e.g. flux) came from the usual:

cd client
npm install flux

React comes from the facebook CDN:

<!-- The core React library -->
<script src="https://fb.me/react-0.14.0.js"></script>
<!-- The ReactDOM Library -->
<script src="https://fb.me/react-dom-0.14.0.js"></script>
