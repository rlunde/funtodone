1) Help people define their main process goals -- what to improve or what is important, usuall including
  a) health
  b) happiness
  c) career
  d) relationships
  e) finances
  f) learning
  g) accomplishments

2) Tasks are inherently both hierarchical and interdependent
  a) one operation is to split up a task into smaller pieces
  b) tags can associate related tasks
  c) dependencies should be flexible and casual
    i) task can't be started before another is done
    ii) task can't be finished before another is done
    iii) task has to be done by a certain time

3) Every task should be tied to one or more goals

4) Every task should have both importance and urgency
  a) use defaults unless set separately
  b) if split a task, use parent's importance/urgency unless specified

5) Every task should be tied to one or more things that make it fun
  a) not the pleasure of finishing it, but the pleasure of doing it
  b) have a lot of preset sources of fun for people to copy and customize
  c) give people some motivation for constantly brainstorming new sources of fun
  d) collect "chicken soup for the soul" type stories about people finding the fun

6) Have a task timer (like pomodoro) with time that can be specified per task

7) Keep score and show history
  a) score should be based on operations done, which type of operation, and which operation
  b) important tasks should count more than unimportant tasks
  c) getting things done should count more than adding new tasks

8) Game operations are:
  a) list tasks (order by age, urgency, importance, ...)
  b) start a task
  c) split a task
  d) mark a task done
  e) add/edit/delete a task
  f) pick a task
    i) do now
    ii) do next
    iii) deal a random task (accept it, or try again)

9) UX should be fun and simple
  a) hide more complicated options with a standard icon to open up options
  b) task completion should be a celebration (even a simple animation)

10) Don't make people enter data they don't (currently) care about
  a) don't insist on using a timer
  b) don't show things globally that people want hidden (e.g. importance and urgency)
  c) let people show / hide things on an item or item hierarchy
