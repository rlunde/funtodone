Currently, there is a client side using react that is not connected to the server side
that uses go. See what-how-where.txt for a desription of how to build and test each side.

The next thing to do is to merge those two sides into one. Something like this:

[ ] make an nginx config that serves up static content and proxies REST API calls to the go service
[ ] gradually move the golang/authboss stuff over into the react client (merge with what's there)
[ ] make some tests of the combined go/authboss/react project
[ ] add an mgo variant of the session store for authboss
[ ] connect the user model from go into authboss, and into mgo, so new users can be created
[ ] make a list of next steps after that to clean up the landing page and finish authentication
