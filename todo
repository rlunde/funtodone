I've decided to try doing the first version of the server side
of this in go (golang), using Gorilla. In my wildest dreams, there will
be a javascript/html front-end that does most of the work, a localstore
option for people who don't want to sync their stuff with a server,
and a simple service/database for people who want to sync.

We'll see. 

So to start my todo list, that I'll delete as soon as funtodone (which is
basically a todo list with more options and attitude than usual) is:

[ ] sketch out a starting UI 
[ ] implement a beginner UI, maybe using flux, react, backbone, marionette
[ ] implement a basic server side web api and web server for the assets
[ ] think about how to make a mobile web app out of it
[ ] expand and fix this list and move it into funtodone
