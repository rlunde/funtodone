Overall project todo:
=====================

[ ] redo the documentation - write more like tutorial than like idea dump
[ ] consolidate and update the README.md files
[ ] consolidate and update the notes
[ ] get client and server barely working together

Client todo (src/client):
=====================

[ ] begin with UI/UX design, sticking to just the essential elements
  [ ] use react, but avoid package managers and dependency hell
  [ ] use bootstrap and plan to do mobile first
  [ ] use TDD -- pick a lightweight framework, even if it doesn't mesh too well with react?
    [ ] this looks like a reasonably good starting point? https://medium.freecodecamp.com/simple-react-testing-d9e25ec87e2#.wmizcb10p

Model next steps (src/funtodone/model):
=======================================

 [ ] add JSON output and parsing
 [ ] add file I/O
 [ ] finish model_test -- see TODO list in that file
 [ ] add priority and date constraints, size, etc. to Tasks
 [ ] add generic metadata to tasks


Service next steps (src/funtodone/service):
===========================================

Authentication:
 [ ] get user login with sessions working
   [ ] combine the react/bootstrap stuff from the client dir with the authboss stuff in the template dir
     [ ] try leaving the client stuff where it is, and see if I can get gin to pull templates from that dir
 [ ] convert users and sessions storage to mongodb
 [ ] get account creation working with mongodb
 [ ] get email account verification working
 [ ] get password change working
 [ ] get password recovery working

Note: I don't plan to implement OAuth2 or account lockout after repeated login failures
(maybe later, but the point of this project is to have fun while getting things done, not
do a complete job of authentication).
