I'm trying to refactor the client starting over from a react
starter.

I'd like to set it up with minimal dependencies. An example
that may come in useful is: 

https://github.com/babel/example-node-server

There is a great page with a link to dozens of different starter
examples here:

http://andrewhfarmer.com/starter-project/

I'm starting with create-react-app which is the "official" way to
start from facebook.

Next Steps:
 [ ] make a super simple SPA page
   [ ] draw it by hand, then 
   [ ] react components to implement layout of SPA page, following tutorial
