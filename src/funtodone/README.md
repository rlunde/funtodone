This is the funtodone namespace, and the subdirectories
here are where the sub-packages go. I think. I'm trying
to find a compromise between what seems to be the
ideomatic golang approach of putting everything in one
directory, and having some control over organization
(and separation of concerns and cohesion) by putting
related things together and unrelated things in different
places. We'll see.
