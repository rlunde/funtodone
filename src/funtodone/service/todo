[ ] refactor session stuff and redo separation of concerns
  [ ] sessions should have their own package
  [ ] session should use an interface for persistence (but not a pluggable "provider")
  [ ] eliminate duplicated code
  [ ] sessions should know about cookies, and be able to set/get key/value pairs from mongodb
  [ ] refactor api to isolate session interactions
  [ ] write some end-to-end integration tests (look at react testing?)
[ ] test session insert
[ ] test session update
[ ] test session read
[ ] test session deletion
[ ] validate the password hash before creating a session
[ ] fix linter errors

I want to move all the session management and auth stuff to
separate packages, and ultimately into a separate microservice.
Auth and sessions have been an annoying impediment to getting
projects done, in part because the code is too tightly coupled
with app code. I'd like to have the only interaction between
the app and the auth/session services be done via REST APIs and
Javascript components.
