[ ] the "provider" is a useless abstraction here (remove it)
[ ] convert the memory session implementation into mongodb
[x] delete the session on logout
[ ] test session deletion
[ ] validate the password hash before creating a session

I want to move all the session management and auth stuff to
separate packages, and ultimately into a separate microservice.
Auth and sessions have been an annoying impediment to getting
projects done, in part because the code is too tightly coupled
with app code. I'd like to have the only interaction between
the app and the auth/session services be done via REST APIs and
Javascript components.
