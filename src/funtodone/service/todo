Next steps for service:

Authentication:
 [ ] get user login with sessions working
 [ ] convert users and sessions storage to mongodb
 [ ] get account creation working with mongodb
 [ ] get email account verification working
 [ ] get password change working
 [ ] get password recovery working

Note: I don't plan to implement OAuth2 or account lockout after repeated login failures
(maybe later, but the point of this project is to have fun while getting things done, not
do a complete job of authentication).
