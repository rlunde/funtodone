Next steps:
 [ ] update model_test -- see TODO list in that file
 [ ] add JSON output and parsing (check for go's conventions for func names?)
 [ ] add file I/O
 [ ] add priority and date constraints, size, etc. to Tasks
 [ ] add generic metadata to tasks
 [ ] add more tests
 [ ] look for test frameworks beyond the basics
