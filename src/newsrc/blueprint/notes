The instructions on setting/resetting the initial mysql root
password were wrong (on the mysql site). I had to log in with
the temporary password that was generated by the mysql intaller,
start mysql using the system preferences pane for mysql, then
run:

mysql -u root -p
<original password>

Then:

mysql> SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('your_new_password');

Also, I had to leave the blueprint install in the usual place
set by GOPATH (see source_me.sh two directories up from here),
even though I want to actually work on it in this location.
I suspect I'll be better off just making this a symlink? Not
sure what to do.
