Adding a little random fun (and a little extra intelligence) to your todo list

# The Enemy

Distraction, procrastination, and constant interruptions are killing our productivity, our self-esteem, our ability
to concentrate, and (possibly due to increased stress as a result) even our health. 

But lets face it -- we're knowledge workers. We can't go hide in the forest and cut ourselves off from the Internet
and still get our work done. 

If you look up procrastination in Amazon, you'll currently find 7129 results among books.
A search for distraction returns another 1775. There are LOTS of software tools already available
that are specifically intended to fight those.

This is another one. But this one is different:

 1. We assume the _*reason*_ people procrastinate is avoidance, not lack of organization
 2. We focus on the _*process*_, and try to make the process itself fun
 3. We add a spoonful of sugar (just like Mary Poppins, back before sugar was evil)

# Why Now?

Things are only going to get worse. 

  * the main economic force driving the internet is advertising
  * advertisers want your eyeballs
  * there's an advertiser standing behind you right now, holding a scalpel!
  * just kidding
  * but seriously, there is more fun and interesting stuff on the net every day: we need to make your work more fun and interesting just to keep up

# Just Imagine

Wouldn't it be great to go to bed at night, and feel like you'd accomplished a lot during the day?

Wouldn't it be great to have visible success, and accomplish big things over time? Imagine that you finally learn
that second language, write that novel, build that dream house, lose that weight, run that marathon,
get that promotion, or create that app everyone's talking about? Or maybe all of the above?

Wouldn't it be great to have a reputation as somebody who gets things done?

# But Wait, What About...?

## Isn't this just some cheesy "gamification" of a ToDo app?

Heck no. You don't need no steenking badges. 

On the other hand, one of the critical steps in improving anything is to measure it, which is basically a way of keeping score.

And on the third hand, the reason gamification got such a bad name so quickly is that legions of wild-eyed hyper-ventilating consultants
oversold it to such a degree that it became a joke before anyone had a chance to see if there was anything to it.

It *is* possible to make the process of planning and keeping track of your actions more fun than you might expect, even if it's
unlikely to make you laugh out loud with glee.

## I don't want to spend hours (or days) entering all my personal data into somebody else's database

Yeah, neither do we. That's why we don't store your data ourselves. Fortunately, there are lots of little companies like
Google (Drive), Microsoft (OneDrive), and Apple (iCloud) -- not to mention Dropbox, Box, and others -- that let you save
your data in cloud storage that is shared across all your devices.

We store all your raw data in JSON format (which means it's easy to import and export, and you can even read it yourself if
you tilt your head and squinch your eyes a bit).

## Where did the ideas for this come from?

It's that Poppins woman! She ... well, that *is* one source, I suppose. But more seriously, here are some of the
