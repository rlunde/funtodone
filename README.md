DISCLAIMER: I'm not expecting anyone to look at this project, or use it, or contribute to it, for
quite a while. I'm using it as a learning exercise more than anything else at the moment, with the
goal of eventually knowing go, bootstrap, backbone, and so on. I will remove this disclaimer when
I think the project has reached MVP (minimum viable project) stage. That won't be for a while.

The main README.md file for this project is in the doc directory.
See: [./doc](https://github.com/rlunde/funtodone/doc)

To build this project:

Note: this is broken right now -- ignore this!

* source source-me.sh
* go get gopkg.in/authboss.v0
* ./install.sh

That will create an executable named funtodone in the bin directory at this top level.
