The main README.md file for this project is down a few levels, following the standard
structure of a Go project, under [./src/github.com/rlunde/funtodone](https://github.com/rlunde/funtodone/tree/master/src/github.com/rlunde/funtodone)

To build this project:

* source source-me.sh
* go get gopkg.in/authboss.v0
* ./install.sh

That will create an executable named funtodone in the bin directory at this top level.
