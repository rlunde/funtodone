Adding a little random fun (and a little extra intelligence) to your todo list

# The Enemy

Distraction, procrastination, and chronic interruptions are killing us. It's not just our
work productivity that is suffering -- it's our health, our self-esteem, and our ability
to concentrate.

Many of us are knowledge workers, and most of the knowledge we work with
comes either from the Internet or our peers. Communication is often the most valuable thing
we can do -- if you can save someone an hour by handling a thirty second interruption, it's nearly
always a good idea. The trouble is, 99.9% of your interruptions don't actually save anyone
any time, they just make it hard for us to get anything accomplished.
